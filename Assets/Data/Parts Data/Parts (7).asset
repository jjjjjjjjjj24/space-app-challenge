  header: Spacecraft Bus
  body: The support operations for the Observatory's operation are provided by the
    spacecraft bus. The electrical power subsystem, the attitude control subsystem,
    the communication subsystem, the command and data handling subsystem, the propulsion
    subsystem, and the thermal control subsystem are the six significant subsystems
    that make up the bus, which is where the spacecraft's operations are carried
    out.
