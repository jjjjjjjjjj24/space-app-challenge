  header: Primary Mirror
  body: 'In terms of collecting area, the primary mirror can be compared to a "light
    bucket" whose power depends on its size (the total amount of area that reflects
    light onto the secondary mirror). It has four scientific equipment to carry out
    its ambitious science operations, a huge sunshield to keep the telescope cool,
    and it is utilized to gather infrared light. '
