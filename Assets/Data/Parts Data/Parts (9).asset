  header: Sunshield
  body: The sunshield divides the observatory into a cool side and a warm, sun-facing
    side (thermal simulations indicate that the outermost layer's maximum temperature
    is 383K, or around 230 degrees F) (with the coldest layer having a modeled minimum
    temp of 36K or around -394 degrees F). The sensitive telescope equipment is protected
    from solar interference by the five-layer sunshield.
