  header: Spitzer Space Telescope
  body: The 2003 launch of the Spitzer Space Telescope is intended to examine the
    early universe in infrared light (unlike Hubble, which mostly observes in visible
    light). Spitzer has made significant discoveries regarding comets, stars, exoplanets,
    and distant galaxies. It was the first telescope to detect light from a planet
    outside of our solar system.
